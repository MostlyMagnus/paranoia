Pawn

pawn_id | user_id | persona_id | role | actionqueue

Also required: An OBJECT object that can accept repair/sabotage/use. Maybe?


Note: Ruby does not support ENUM. One way to do it is to have a helper class with a set of defined constants:

class Enum
     ENUM1 = 15 
     ENUM2 = 17
end

A constant value is identified by a leading capitol letter.


Actions

repair
sabotage
use

investigate
interrogate (agent)
kill (traitor)
move

Re: Possible Actions

An array of a two variable struct

possibleActions
  S_Action
    Text
    Params

That way, the frontend can simply do a 

possibleActions.each do |action| 
  # Print all possible actions, parse params into POST data.
end
